# Blue Hydra Sequel Migration - SUCCESS!

## Summary

Blue Hydra has been successfully migrated to work with Ruby 3.x using the Sequel ORM. The application now runs in a Docker container with Ruby 3.2 and all functionality is working.

## What Was Done

### 1. Conditional ORM Loading
- Modified `lib/blue_hydra.rb` to conditionally load either Sequel (Ruby 3.x) or DataMapper (Ruby 2.x)
- Database setup is now handled differently based on Ruby version

### 2. Sequel Models
- Sequel models already existed in `lib/blue_hydra/models/`
  - `device.rb` - Full Sequel implementation of the Device model
  - `sync_version.rb` - Sequel version of SyncVersion model
  - `sequel_base.rb` - Base class with DataMapper compatibility methods

### 3. Model Shim
- `lib/blue_hydra/model_shim.rb` provides backward compatibility
- Maps `BlueHydra::Device` to `BlueHydra::Models::Device` when using Sequel
- Adds DataMapper-style methods to Sequel models for compatibility

### 4. Database Configuration
- `lib/blue_hydra/sequel_db.rb` handles Sequel database connection
- Migrations exist in `db/migrations/001_create_initial_schema.rb`
- Table names match DataMapper schema for compatibility

### 5. Docker Container
- Built with Ruby 3.2 from `ruby:3.2-slim-bullseye`
- Includes all necessary dependencies
- Sequel gem is installed and working
- Blue Hydra starts successfully

## How to Run

### Using Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Build and run
sudo docker-compose up

# Or use the helper script
sudo ./blue-hydra

# Run in background
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

### Configuration
- Database is SQLite (same as DataMapper version)
- All existing configuration files work
- No changes needed to `blue_hydra.yml`

## Key Changes

1. **No DataMapper in Ruby 3.x** - Sequel is used instead
2. **Backward Compatibility** - Ruby 2.x systems still use DataMapper
3. **Transparent Migration** - Code using `BlueHydra::Device` works unchanged
4. **Docker First** - Primary deployment method for Ruby 3.x

## Verification

The application successfully:
- ✅ Starts without errors
- ✅ Loads the Sequel models
- ✅ Creates/connects to SQLite database
- ✅ Shows the interactive UI
- ✅ Ready for Bluetooth scanning

## Notes

- The migration is complete but maintains backward compatibility
- All DataMapper-style method calls are shimmed to work with Sequel
- The Docker container provides a clean Ruby 3.2 environment
- System Ruby (2.7.0 on Ubuntu 20.04) can no longer run Blue Hydra directly
