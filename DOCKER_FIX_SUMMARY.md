# Blue Hydra Docker Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Syntax Error in `sequel_db.rb`**
- **Problem**: Ruby 3.2 doesn't allow inline `rescue` modifier inside hash literals
- **Fix**: Moved the database size calculation outside the hash:
```ruby
# Before (invalid):
database_size: File.size(database_path) rescue 0

# After (valid):
db_size = begin
  File.size(database_path)
rescue
  0
end
database_size: db_size
```

### 2. **D-Bus PID File Issue**
- **Problem**: Container was restarting due to existing D-Bus PID file
- **Fix**: Created proper `docker-entrypoint.sh` that cleans up PID files:
```bash
# Clean up any existing PID file
rm -f /run/dbus/pid /run/dbus/system_bus_socket
```

### 3. **Run Script Updated**
- **Problem**: `docker-compose run` was creating temporary containers
- **Fix**: Changed to use `docker-compose up` for proper service management

## Current Status

The Docker container is now properly configured with:
- ✅ Ruby 3.2 with Sequel ORM
- ✅ Fixed syntax errors
- ✅ Proper D-Bus startup
- ✅ Correct entrypoint script
- ✅ Service configuration in docker-compose.yml

## How to Use

### Run Blue Hydra (Foreground)
```bash
sudo ./run-blue-hydra.sh
```

### Run Blue Hydra (Background)
```bash
sudo ./run-blue-hydra.sh -d
```

```bash
sudo docker-compose logs -f
```

### Stop Blue Hydra
```bash
sudo docker-compose down
```

## Notes

- Blue Hydra is configured to run with the `--rssi-api` flag to keep it running
- The container runs with `privileged: true` for Bluetooth hardware access
- Uses host networking mode for proper Bluetooth device access
- Database and logs are mounted as volumes for persistence

## Known Issues

1. **Database Corruption**: The previous log shows a database corruption issue. If this happens:
   - Stop the container: `sudo docker-compose down`
   - Remove the corrupt database: `rm -rf blue_hydra.db blue_hydra.db.corrupt`
   - Restart: `sudo ./run-blue-hydra.sh`

2. **Bluetooth Access**: The container needs privileged mode and host network for Bluetooth. Make sure:
   - Bluetooth is enabled on the host
   - No other Bluetooth scanners are running
   - The user has proper permissions
